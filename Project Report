# Project Report

## Extract

The sources we are using in this project is csv files from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/mens-professional-basketball?select=basketball_awards_players.csv) and data.world (https://data.world/datadavis/nba-salaries) with data about NBA players from 1937 to 2012


## Transform

After reading each csv file to python and create a dataframe, we find out each csv file has much more information than we neede, so we clean the data by dropping those unnecessary and duplicated information. 
For easy access and reference in later analysis, we rename the keys names.Finally, we have three dataframes with cleaned data:players_df; awards_df; salary_df 

## Load

With the information we have, we were able to creat a relational database basketball_db with three tables inside:players,awards and salaries.

We load the data previously cleaned up to the above database and confirm all the data is loaded successfully.

Some queries were done across the relational database and we were able to get a complete dataframe with all the players' information we are interested including player_id, last_name, first_name, awards_count and max salary.

# Analysis
Get a tableframe with data about top players with more than ten awards 
Get a tableframe with data about players with top ten max salaries
A regression analysis is conducted to show the relationship between players' awards_count and max salary.
It turned out there is no significant relation between players' awards_count and max salary. The reason could be players who played basketball for many years tend to have more awards and salary years ago can not match today's and young players with less awards tend to have high salary with current salary standard.
